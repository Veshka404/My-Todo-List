# Todo App in Python 📝

Hi Folks, here is my 2nd Python hands-on project : A very simple Todo App. 
This app allows you to add, view, complete, and delete tasks through the command line.
As I said on my 1st README's hands-on project, I'm starting small. With this Todo App, I'm exploring the very basics of object-oriented programming and dictionary management in Python. 
Hence, I’m diving deeper into coding practice and sharing my journey in becoming proficient in Python.
That is why, I did choose to start with this project for it helps me work on core programming concepts like data structures, loops, and conditional statements. 

# Benefits of a MyTodo App ?

Well, a to-do list can be a powerful productivity tool, if you Folks want to stay organized and focused. 
Here are some of the main advantages:

--> Improves Focus and Organization
By writing down tasks, you get a clear view of what needs to be done, allowing you to organize and prioritize them effectively. 

--> Boosts Productivity
Checking off completed tasks gives a sense of accomplishment, since you can track what's done and what's left.

--> Reduces Stress
Reducing mental clutter and keeps you from worrying about forgetting something. 

--> Helps with Prioritization
You can easily identify high-priority tasks and tackle them first. As a matter of fact, you know that critical work gets completed on time, preventing last-minute rushes.

--> Encourages Goal Tracking
A to-do list is a very simple way to break down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps. 

--> Promotes Accountability
Writting down tasks prevent you from ignoring them.

--> Builds Positive Habits
Setting a routine for organizing and completing tasks, help you build positive habits around productivity and time management.

## Features
- **Add tasks:** To add a new task with a description (with unique IDs).
- **View tasks:** To display all tasks with their completion status.
- **Complete tasks:** To mark and update task status to complete.
- **Delete tasks:** To remove task (by ID) from the list.

## Lessons Learned
This project helped me understand:
--> How to create and manage dictionaries in Python.
--> The basics of class creation and method structuring.
--> How to build a CLI app that interacts with users.

## Usage
Clone this repository, then run the following command to start the app:
```bash
python todo_app.py
